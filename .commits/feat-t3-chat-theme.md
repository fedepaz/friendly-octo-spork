feat: Implement new T3-Chat theme and UI refinements

This commit introduces a new UI theme called "T3-Chat" and refactors several components to use it. This change modernizes the application's look and feel and improves the overall user experience.

- **New Theme:** The `t3chat.css` file has been added, defining a new color palette, typography, and shadow styles. The `main.css` file has been updated to import this new theme.
- **Component Refactoring:** The `Navbar` and `LoginPage` components have been refactored to align with the new design system.
- **UX Agent Documentation:** The `ux_agent_finance.md` file has been updated with more detailed guidelines for the UX/UI Designer agent, including a new design checklist and a prompt template for Gemini CLI.
