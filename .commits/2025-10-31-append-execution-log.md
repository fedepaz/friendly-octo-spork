docs: Append execution log to gemini_db_exec_prompt.md

Appended a detailed execution log to `docs/guides/gemini_db_exec_prompt.md`. This log documents the steps taken, issues encountered, and their resolutions during the SQL migration execution process. It serves as a historical record and a starting point for future work on this task.

The log covers:
- Initial execution attempts and temporary file path correction.
- Resolution of PostgreSQL role existence and permissions for user '0001'.
- Evolution of SQL execution strategy from direct file execution to piping, and finally to copying files into the container.
- Granting of necessary schema, table, and sequence privileges.
- Handling of `updatedAt` NOT NULL constraint.
- Resolution of foreign key constraint violation due to incorrect Account IDs.
