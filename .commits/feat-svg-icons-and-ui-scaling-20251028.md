feat: Replace emojis with SVG icons and scale down UI

This commit introduces two main improvements:
- Replaces all emoji icons with SVG icons for a more professional and consistent look. A new `icons` directory has been created to store the SVG components.
- Reduces the base font size of the application to create a more compact and data-dense UI, as requested.
