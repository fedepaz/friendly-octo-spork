feat: Remove redundant test files

Removed duplicate test files from `finance-app/tests/api/transactions.test.ts`,
`tests/services/accounts.test.ts`, `tests/services/auth.test.ts`,
`tests/services/categories.test.ts`, `tests/services/dashboard.test.ts`,
`tests/services/recurrences.test.ts`, and `tests/services/transactions.test.ts`.
These tests were either redundant or have been refactored into other test suites.
No documentation updates are required for this change.
