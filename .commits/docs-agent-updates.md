docs: Update agent profiles with new architecture and design

This commit updates the core agent documentation to align with the project's recent evolution.

- **Architecture:** The `architect` and `backend` agent profiles now formally define and enforce the **Vertical Slicing (Feature-Based) Architecture**, ensuring all new development is organized by feature.

- **UI/UX:** The `frontend` and `ux` profiles have been updated to reflect the new **Neo-Brutalism** design language. This includes principles, the new CSS variable-based color and typography systems, and the feature-based file organization for UI components.
