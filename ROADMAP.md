## **Project Roadmap: Personal Finance Tracker**

### **Stage 1: MVP - Manual Entry & Core Functionality (Estimated: 2-3 weeks)**

The goal of this stage is to build a functional application that replaces the basic use of a spreadsheet for tracking personal finances.

**Phase 1.1: Project Setup and Architecture**
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Initialize Project Structure:** Set up the initial folders for `src`, `prisma`, `tests`, etc.
    2.  **Development Environment:** Create `Dockerfile.dev` and `docker-compose.yml` for a local development environment with hot-reloading. (Responsible: **DevOps Agent**)
    3.  **Database Schema:** Design and create the initial Prisma schema for `User`, `Expense`, `Payment`, `Category`, and `Budget`. (Responsible: **System Architect**)
    4.  **API Architecture:** Define the Hono API routes and the structure for request/response validation using Zod. (Responsible: **System Architect**)
    5.  **Initial Migration:** Create and run the first database migration. (Responsible: **Backend Agent**)

**Phase 1.2: User Authentication**
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Integrate Clerk:** Add Clerk middleware to the Hono application for authentication. (Responsible: **Backend Agent**)
    2.  **Login/Logout UI:** Create the necessary server-rendered pages and HTMX interactions for user sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out. (Responsible: **Frontend Agent**)

**Phase 1.3: Expense Management**
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **CRUD APIs for Expenses:** Implement the Hono API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting expenses. All endpoints must be protected and filter by the authenticated user. (Responsible: **Backend Agent**)
    2.  **Expense Form UI:** Create the expense entry form as a server-rendered component (Hono JSX). (Responsible: **Frontend Agent**)
    3.  **Expense List UI:** Create the table to display expenses, including filtering and pagination controls. (Responsible: **Frontend Agent**)
    4.  **HTMX Interactions:** Implement the HTMX attributes for form submission, inline editing, and deletion of expenses. (Responsible: **Frontend Agent**)

**Phase 1.4: Dashboard and Reporting**
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Dashboard API:** Create an API endpoint that calculates and returns key metrics like total monthly spending, budget status, and recent expenses. (Responsible: **Backend Agent**)
    2.  **Dashboard UI:** Design and implement the main dashboard page with stat cards and a summary of recent activity. (Responsible: **UX/UI Designer**, **Frontend Agent**)
    3.  **Monthly Report:** Implement a basic monthly summary report showing expenses by category. (Responsible: **Backend Agent**, **Frontend Agent**)

**Phase 1.5: Testing and Quality Assurance**
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **API Tests:** Write unit and integration tests for all API endpoints using Bun's test runner. (Responsible: **QA Agent**)
    2.  **E2E Tests:** Create end-to-end tests with Playwright for the main user flows: signing up, adding an expense, and filtering the expense list. (Responsible: **QA Agent**)
    3.  **Security Scan:** Perform a quick security scan for common vulnerabilities like IDOR and XSS. (Responsible: **Security Analyst**)

### **Stage 3: Advanced Features & AI (Future)**

*   **Goal:** Provide intelligent insights and advanced tracking capabilities.
*   **High-Level Features:**
    *   Integration with financial market APIs (e.g., Binance, stock exchanges).
    *   AI-powered analysis of spending habits and budget recommendations.
    *   Investment tracking and performance visualization.
