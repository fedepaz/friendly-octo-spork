## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Replace Navbar with Sidebar (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the main navigation to be presented as a sidebar instead of a top navbar, so that I have a consistent navigation experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the core request of the feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating the application and observing the presence and functionality of the sidebar.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user views the application on a desktop, **Then** a sidebar navigation is displayed on the left side of the screen.
2. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user navigates through different pages, **Then** the sidebar remains visible and functional.

### User Story 2 - Remove Logout Button from Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the logout button to be removed from the main navigation (sidebar), so that it's not prominently displayed with other navigation items.

**Why this priority**: This is an explicit requirement from the user.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the absence of the logout button in the sidebar navigation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user views the sidebar navigation, **Then** no logout button is present within the sidebar.

### User Story 3 - Responsive Sidebar for Mobile (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the sidebar to automatically hide when viewing the application on a mobile device, so that the content area is maximized.

**Why this priority**: This ensures a good user experience on smaller screens.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by resizing the browser window or viewing the application on a mobile device and observing the sidebar's visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user views the application on a mobile device (or a narrow viewport), **Then** the sidebar navigation is hidden by default.
2.  **Given** the application is loaded on a mobile device, **When** the user interacts with a mechanism to show the sidebar (e.g., a hamburger menu), **Then** the sidebar becomes visible.
3.  **Given** the application is loaded on a mobile device and the sidebar is visible, **When** the user interacts with a mechanism to hide the sidebar (e.g., clicking outside the sidebar or a close button), **Then** the sidebar becomes hidden.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user resizes the browser window from desktop to mobile and vice-versa? The sidebar should adapt its visibility accordingly.
- How does the system handle navigation when the sidebar is hidden on mobile? A clear mechanism (e.g., hamburger menu) should be available to reveal it.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST replace the existing top navigation bar with a left-aligned sidebar navigation.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST ensure the sidebar navigation contains all existing navigation links, excluding the logout button.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST hide the sidebar navigation by default when the viewport width corresponds to a mobile device.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a clear mechanism (e.g., a hamburger menu icon) to show/hide the sidebar navigation on mobile devices.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST ensure the sidebar navigation is responsive and adapts its layout and behavior based on the screen size.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a logout option within a dedicated "Profile" or "Account" section/page.
- **FR-007**: The sidebar navigation MUST be fully navigable via keyboard (tab, arrow keys) and provide appropriate ARIA attributes for screen reader support.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of users can successfully navigate the application using the new sidebar on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **SC-002**: The sidebar navigation is hidden by default on mobile viewports, allowing for maximum content display.
- **SC-003**: The transition between showing and hiding the sidebar on mobile devices is visually smooth as perceived by the user.
