# Implementation Plan: Sidebar Navigation

**Branch**: `001-sidebar-navigation` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: /home/fedepaz/Documents/proyectos/appFinance/specs/001-sidebar-navigation/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/fedepaz/Documents/proyectos/appFinance/specs/001-sidebar-navigation/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary
The primary requirement is to replace the existing top navigation bar with a responsive sidebar navigation, removing the logout button from the main navigation, and ensuring accessibility. The technical approach will involve leveraging the existing Hono + HTMX + Tailwind stack to implement the sidebar, focusing on a smooth user experience across desktop and mobile, with a hamburger menu for mobile interaction and a dedicated profile section for logout.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Bun runtime)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Hono, HTMX, Tailwind CSS, Tabler UI  
**Storage**: N/A (UI feature)  
**Testing**: Unit tests for UI components, integration tests for navigation flows.  
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop and mobile browsers)
**Project Type**: Web  
**Performance Goals**: Visually smooth transitions as perceived by the user.  
**Constraints**: Must adhere to existing project conventions (Hono, HTMX, Tailwind, Tabler UI). No client-side JS frameworks.  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user finance tracker application.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Single Source of Truth**: Clear. This feature is UI-focused and does not directly impact the data model.
- **II. Ultra-minimal UX with HTMX**: Clear. The plan aligns with using HTMX for dynamic interactions and maintaining a minimal UX.
- **III. SSR-First**: Clear. The plan adheres to server-side rendering with Hono JSX.
- **IV. Developer Simplicity & User Speed**: Clear. The plan prioritizes simplicity and user speed, avoiding complex client-side state.
- **V. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Clear. Testing is included in the plan.

    └── integration/ # Integration tests for navigation flows
```

**Structure Decision**: The project will utilize the existing `frontend/src` structure, introducing new components for the sidebar and hamburger menu, and updating the main layout to integrate the sidebar. Styling will be managed via Tailwind CSS.
