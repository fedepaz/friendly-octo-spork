# Tasks: Sidebar Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `001-sidebar-navigation` | **Date**: 2025-10-25

## Phase 1: Setup

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

- [x] T001 Create base sidebar component structure in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- [x] T002 Create hamburger menu component structure in `frontend/src/components/HamburgerMenu.tsx`
- [x] T003 Update main layout to integrate sidebar and hamburger menu in `frontend/src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`
- [x] T004 Configure Tailwind CSS for sidebar styling and responsiveness in `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` and `frontend/src/styles/main.css`

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Replace Navbar with Sidebar (P1)

**Story Goal**: As a user, I want the main navigation to be presented as a sidebar instead of a top navbar, so that I have a consistent navigation experience.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by navigating the application and observing the presence and functionality of the sidebar on desktop.

- [x] T005 [P] [US1] Implement desktop sidebar rendering with navigation links in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Apply active link styling based on current route in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- [x] T007 [US1] Remove existing navbar from `frontend/src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`
- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Write unit tests for `Sidebar.tsx` component in `frontend/tests/unit/Sidebar.test.ts`
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Write integration tests for desktop navigation flow with sidebar in `frontend/tests/integration/navigation.test.ts`

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Remove Logout Button from Navigation (P1)

**Story Goal**: As a user, I want the logout button to be removed from the main navigation (sidebar), so that it's not prominently displayed with other navigation items.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by verifying the absence of the logout button in the sidebar navigation and the presence of logout functionality in the profile page.

- [x] T010 [P] [US2] Remove logout button from `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- [x] T011 [P] [US2] Implement a dedicated "Profile" or "Account" section/page for logout functionality in `frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`
- [x] T012 [US2] Add a link to the "Profile" or "Account" section in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- [x] T013 [P] [US2] Write unit tests to verify absence of logout button in sidebar in `frontend/tests/unit/Sidebar.test.ts`
- [x] T014 [P] [US2] Write integration tests for logout functionality via "Profile" page in `frontend/tests/integration/logout.test.ts`

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Responsive Sidebar for Mobile (P1)

**Story Goal**: As a user, I want the sidebar to automatically hide when viewing the application on a mobile device, so that the content area is maximized.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Can be fully tested by resizing the browser window or viewing the application on a mobile device and observing the sidebar's visibility and interaction.

- [x] T015 [P] [US3] Implement mobile-first responsive styling for sidebar (hidden by default) in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` and `frontend/src/styles/main.css`
- [x] T016 [P] [US3] Implement hamburger menu toggle functionality using HTMX in `frontend/src/components/HamburgerMenu.tsx`
- [x] T017 [US3] Integrate hamburger menu into `frontend/src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`
- [x] T018 [P] [US3] Implement accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes) for sidebar and hamburger menu in `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/HamburgerMenu.tsx`
- [x] T019 [P] [US3] Write unit tests for `HamburgerMenu.tsx` component in `frontend/tests/unit/HamburgerMenu.test.ts`
- [x] T020 [P] [US3] Write integration tests for mobile sidebar show/hide functionality and navigation in `frontend/tests/integration/navigation.test.ts`

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T021 Review and refine overall sidebar styling and animations for visual smoothness in `frontend/src/styles/main.css`
- [x] T022 Conduct cross-browser and device compatibility testing for the sidebar navigation.
- [x] T023 Update `quickstart.md` with any final usage instructions or customization options.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Replace Navbar with Sidebar) MUST be completed before User Story 2.
- User Story 2 (Remove Logout Button from Navigation) MUST be completed before User Story 3.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **User Story 1**: Tasks T005 and T006 can be done in parallel. Tasks T008 and T009 can be done in parallel.
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T010 and T011 can be done in parallel. Tasks T013 and T014 can be done in parallel.
- **User Story 3**: Tasks T015 and T016 can be done in parallel. Tasks T018, T019, and T020 can be done in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

This feature will be implemented using an MVP-first approach, delivering each user story as an independently testable increment. User Story 1 will form the initial MVP, followed by User Story 2, and then User Story 3. This allows for incremental delivery and feedback.
